🐦‍⬛​ Welcome to the Singularikey project. Coded in Python, the aim of the project is to understand how it works and to improve my level of code. For now, the code is pretty simple, with multiples functionnality :

- ⌨️ Basic keylogger functionnality : records all keys pressed by the user (I'm using keyboard module)
- 📄 More clarity in recording result : UTF-8 encoding, Special & Function key highlighted + anti-repeat function
- 📆 Timestamp for each recording session
- 📥 Buffering system
- 👃 Clipboard Sniffer : Intercepts and logs clipboard contents when Ctrl+C is detected.
- 🚀 Sends log files to a configured remote server after a cooldown period.
- 🚀 Sends a Telegram message notification with system information upon upload.
- 🧼 Overwrites log file contents with random bytes after sending to avoid recovery.
- 🪟 Optimized for Windows

More coming soon...
