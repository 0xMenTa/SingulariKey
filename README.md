🐦‍⬛​ Welcome to the Singularikey project. Coded in Python, the aim of the project is to understand how it works and to improve my level of code. For now, the code is pretty simple, with multiples functionnality :

- ⌨️ Basic keylogger functionnality : records all keys pressed by the user (I'm using keyboard module)
- 📄 More clarity in recording result : UTF-8 encoding, Special & Function key highlighted + anti-repeat function
- 📆 Timestamp for each recording session
- 📥 Buffering system

More coming soon
